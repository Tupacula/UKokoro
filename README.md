VGS 2019 final project, written in Ren'py.

Resolution:
Game resolution is currently 1280x720. It is relatively difficult to regenerate
assets to change this, so make sure images you add fit onscreen.

Labels:
Though not strictly necessary, I've made a label for each day. In this way it 
helps organize for future use. Also, indentation is important. If you see

label example:

    ##stuff in label

##stuff outside label

Think of the example as a "room", and everything after the colon that's with an
indent as in the room. Once there's no indent, then you have left the room. 
Indents are a tab or four spaces (I think Atom autoconverts between the two).

Line length:

It is good practice to keep lines short, as in under 80 characters. There's a 
guiding line in Atom, and you can see row:column in the lower left. For 
dialogue, you can avoid this just by pressing enter and starting a new line 
directly (everything's in the quotes, and the new line of code DOES NOT 
make a new line in the Ren'Py texy).
